My name is Sajarin, but people find it easier to call me Saj. I'm currently a Sophomore pursuing a BA in Computer Science at Hunter College. 

### More Information

I'm currently into origami and learning about how the brain works. On another note, if you want to work on any projects, feel free to reach out!
